> My testing playground. Currently testing things for swarmpack.js to try making a CDN using express.js and webtorrent.

##Packages

* `webtorrent`: WebRTC in browser, TCP/IP in nodejs

##Plan

- [ ] Initial creation of torrent
- [ ] Add web seeds to torrent
- [ ] Download file from remote
- [ ] Save infohash in database or file
- [ ] Delete .torrent & file
- [ ] Test downloading on [btorrent](https://btorrent.xyz/).
